Participants of the show start with the first prize category. They get a question and 4 options. 

For example:

| What do you call coffee with a shot of whiskey and whipped cream? |
|-----------|
| A: Scottish Delight | 
| B: Irish Coffee | 
| C: English Cream |
| D: Nessies Dream |

What would you say 😉❓ It's answer B.

If the participant answers the question correctly he/she goes to the next question and prize level.

If your answer to a question is false than you either get the prize money from the last security level (security levels are 5th and 10th level) or if you haven't reached a security level yet you get nothing.

You also have the option to stop the quiz game at any time. In that case you will get the prize money from the last prize level for which you successfully answered the question.
